Never miss  a lecture session at NIT Nagpur.

This repository consists of code written using HTML and CSS. Also a favicon is used which was made by me. Here not only week wise, lecture timings are mentioned but also the class links are provided to enter the online class directly using the time table. Color for hovering over a lecture subject and style variations also included(underlining). Different colors are used for different subjects for easy and quick access.
